<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    The main architect of the city want to build new highest building.<br>
    You have to help him find current highest building in the city.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img  title="The highest building" src="{{MEDIA}}example.jpg" alt="example" style="max-height: 283px"/>
</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Heights of buildings as 2D-array.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Number of building and it's height as list of integers (Important: in this task the numbers of buildings are started from "1", not from "0") 
</p>


<!-- Put some usage examples -->

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Every true programer should know how to work with 2D-arrays.
</p>

<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p><strong>Precondition</strong>:<br>
    array width <= 10<br>
    array height <= 10<br>
    There is only 1 highest building in each array
